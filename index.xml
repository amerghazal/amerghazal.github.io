      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m eager to use this place to collect and critique some heuristics, laws, and smells that have become valuable to me, recently. These heuristics help in many ways, not least of which developing and designing software and systems. What makes them so useful is that they more often than not make a conclusion or at least a direction towards a conclusion almost immediately available. There&amp;rsquo;s danger in that, of course, but there&amp;rsquo;s also a good deal of danger in the trek of drawn-out analysis.</description>
